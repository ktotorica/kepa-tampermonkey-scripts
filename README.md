# kepa-tampermonkey-scripts
These are some tamper monkey scripts that I wrote that I have found useful.

**Force ignore whitespace in github diff.user**<br/>
This will auto ignore any whitespace changes in a PR and when opening a PR in github.

**Refresh AWS session.user**<br/>
This will refresh the users token for aws to avoid the dreaded session expiration.

**Close Aws Landing Page Tab After 3 Minutes if Inactive.user**<br/>
This will automatically close the page opened by the Refresh AWS session.user script after 3 minutes.
